# Normalization Information Display in Dataset Cards

## Summary of Implementation

I have successfully implemented the display of normalization information in dataset cards and details modal, specifically showing whether original columns were kept during normalization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dataset Cards (Grid View)
- Added a **normalization badge** below the parent dataset name
- The badge shows:
  - **Blue badge with shield icon** (`bi-shield-check`) when original columns were kept
    - Shows count: "X columnas originales conservadas"
  - **Purple badge with gear icon** (`bi-gear`) when no original columns were kept
    - Shows: "Sin columnas originales"

### 2. Dataset Details Modal
- Added a new section "Información de normalización" after the parent dataset info
- Shows **detailed per-column information**:
  - Column name
  - Normalization method chain (e.g., "MIN_MAX → Z_SCORE")
  - Badge indicating if original was kept:
    - **Blue badge**: "Original conservada" with shield icon
    - **Gray badge**: "Original eliminada" with X icon

### 3. Functions Added

#### `getNormalizationBadge(normalizationMethod)`
- Parses the normalization configuration stored in the database
- Counts how many columns have `keep_original = true`
- Returns HTML for the badge to display on cards

#### `getDetailedNormalizationInfo(normalizationMethod)`
- Parses the normalization configuration
- Creates detailed HTML showing each column's:
  - Applied methods (supports multi-layer chains)
  - Keep original status
- Returns formatted HTML for the modal display

### 4. Visual Design
- **Colors**:
  - `#00d4ff` (cyan) - When columns are kept
  - `#9333ea` (purple) - When no columns are kept
  - Info/Secondary Bootstrap classes for detailed badges
- **Icons**:
  - `bi-shield-check` - Columns preserved
  - `bi-gear` - Standard normalization
  - `bi-x-circle` - Column removed

### 5. Data Parsing
- Handles multiple normalization config formats:
  - Multi-layer arrays: `[{method: "MIN_MAX", keep_original: true}, ...]`
  - Single layer objects: `{method: "Z_SCORE", keep_original: false}`
  - Legacy string format
- Robust error handling for malformed data

## User Benefits

1. **At a glance** - Users can quickly see which normalized datasets preserved original columns
2. **Detailed view** - Click on a dataset to see exactly which columns were kept/removed
3. **Visual clarity** - Color coding and icons make it easy to understand the normalization state
4. **Complete information** - Both the methods used and preservation status are visible

## Testing
All functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✓ Badge displays correctly on dataset cards
- ✓ Column count is accurate
- ✓ Detailed modal shows per-column information
- ✓ Visual indicators work as expected
- ✓ Error handling for malformed data

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
