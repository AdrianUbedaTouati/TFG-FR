# Column Removal Fix Summary

## Problem
When normalizing a dataset column, the original column was always retained regardless of the "Mantener columna original" (Keep original column) checkbox state. The expected behavior is that columns should be removed by default unless the checkbox is explicitly checked.

## Root Causes Identified

### Frontend Issues (normalize.html)
1. **Line 2380-2381**: Default value for `keep_original` was set to `true` for all but the last layer in multi-layer normalizations
2. **Line 2411**: For custom functions, `keep_original` was always forced to `true`

### Backend Issues (normalization_views.py)
1. **Line 424**: Default value for `keep_original` in single normalization was `True` instead of `False`

## Fixes Applied

### Frontend Changes (normalize.html)
1. Changed default `keep_original` value from `layerIndex < normalizationConfig[column].length - 1` to `false`
2. For custom functions, now respects the existing configuration instead of forcing `true`

### Backend Changes (normalization_views.py)
1. Changed the default for `keep_original` from `True` to `False` in single normalization dict config

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Single Layer Normalization
- **Checkbox unchecked (default)**: Original column is transformed in place (for methods like MIN_MAX, Z_SCORE, LOWER, etc.)
- **Checkbox checked**: Original column is kept, new column with suffix is created

### Multi-Layer Normalization
- **All checkboxes unchecked (default)**: Original column is removed, only normalized columns remain
- **At least one checkbox checked**: Original column is kept along with all intermediate normalized columns

### Custom Functions
- **Checkbox unchecked (default)**: Original column is removed if the custom function specifies `remove_original_column=True`
- **Checkbox checked**: Original column is always kept

## Testing
A test script `test_column_removal.py` has been created to verify all scenarios work correctly. The script tests:
1. Single normalization with `keep_original=False`
2. Single normalization with `keep_original=True`
3. Multi-layer normalization with all `keep_original=False`
4. Multi-layer normalization with at least one `keep_original=True`
5. Text normalization with `keep_original=False`

## Usage Notes
- The checkbox is now **unchecked by default** for all normalization methods
- Users must explicitly check the box if they want to keep the original column
- This provides a cleaner dataset by default, removing redundant columns after normalization
