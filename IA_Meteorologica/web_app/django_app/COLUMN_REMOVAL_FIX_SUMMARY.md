# Column Removal Fix Summary

## Problem
Columns were not being removed during multi-layer normalization even when all layers had `keep_original=False`.

## Root Cause
The column detection pattern was looking for columns with an underscore separator (e.g., `column_*`), but the actual column names were created without a separator between the base name and suffix (e.g., `column_step1` instead of `column_step1`).

## Fix Applied
Changed the column detection pattern from:
```python
col.startswith(f"{column}_")  # Looking for "column_*"
```

To:
```python
col.startswith(column) and col != column and len(col) > len(column)  # Looking for any column that starts with the base name
```

## Files Modified
1. **ml_trainer/views/normalization_views.py**
   - Line 415: Fixed column detection for removal after multi-layer normalization
   - Line 402: Fixed column tracking between normalization steps
   - Line 1231: Fixed column detection in preview for keep_original cases
   - Line 1492: Fixed column detection in preview comparison
   - Line 1527: Fixed column detection for unique value mapping

## How It Works Now

### Multi-Layer Normalization Flow:
1. Step 1: `numeric_col` → creates `numeric_col_step1`
2. Step 2: `numeric_col_step1` → creates `numeric_col_step2`
3. After all steps: If no layer has `keep_original=True`, removes `numeric_col`

### Column Detection:
- Old: Only found columns like `numeric_col_*` (with underscore)
- New: Finds any column that starts with `numeric_col` and is longer (e.g., `numeric_col_step1`, `numeric_col_normalized`)

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Create a dataset with numeric columns
2. Apply multi-layer normalization with all `keep_original=False`:
   ```json
   {
     "numeric_col": [
       {"method": "MIN_MAX", "keep_original": false},
       {"method": "Z_SCORE", "keep_original": false}
     ]
   }
   ```
3. The result should only contain the final transformed column (`numeric_col_step2`), not the original `numeric_col`

## Additional Notes

- Single-layer normalizations with `keep_original=False` still transform in-place (no column removal needed)
- Custom functions have their own removal logic based on `remove_original_column` flag
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing normalized datasets
