# Training Log Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to correct training log issues:
1. Incorrect train/val split percentages displayed in fold logs
2. Premature log termination while training continues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Train/Val Split Display
**Issue**: The logs always showed "85% / 15%" regardless of the actual configured values in Module 2.

**Root Cause**: The code was correctly retrieving the values from the execution strategy but not formatting them correctly for display.

**Fix**: Updated the logging to properly calculate and display the actual percentages:
```python
# Get the actual train/val proportions used
actual_train_pct = int(cv_train_size * 100)
actual_val_pct = int(cv_val_size * 100)
progress_callback.log_message(f"   ðŸ”„ Division train/val dans le fold: {actual_train_pct}% / {actual_val_pct}%")
```

### 2. Premature Log Termination
**Issue**: Logs would stop displaying updates while Random Forest training was still ongoing during cross-validation.

**Root Cause**: The `update_progress()` method was being called too frequently during tree training, which could trigger completion status before all trees were trained.

**Fix**: Modified the progress update logic to only update the message (not progress) during intermediate tree training:
```python
# Only update message, not progress, to avoid premature log termination
if trees_trained < n_estimators:
    progress_callback.log_message(
        f"Fold {fold}/{n_splits} - {trees_trained}/{n_estimators} arbres - Score: {current_score:.4f}"
    )
else:
    # Only update progress when trees are fully trained
    progress_callback.update_progress(
        overall_progress,
        f"Fold {fold}/{n_splits} - {trees_trained}/{n_estimators} arbres - Score: {current_score:.4f}"
    )
```

## Impact
These fixes ensure that:
1. The displayed train/val split percentages match the actual configured values
2. Training logs continue to display throughout the entire training process
3. Users get accurate real-time feedback about training progress

## Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/Users/andri/Desktop/TFG_FR/IA_Meteorologica/web_app/django_app/ml_trainer/ml_utils.py`
  - Lines ~1335: Fixed train/val split percentage display
  - Lines ~1402-1407: Fixed premature log termination for Random Forest training

## Testing
To verify these fixes:
1. Configure a cross-validation training with custom train/val splits (e.g., 70%/30%)
2. Start training and verify the logs show the correct percentages
3. Monitor the entire training process to ensure logs continue until completion
