# Model Naming and Best Accuracy Display Fix

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented for:
1. Saving trained models with meaningful names (model_name_trainingNumber)
2. Clarifying the "best accuracy" display during training

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Model File Naming
- **Issue**: Models were saved with generic names like `model_123.pkl` using only the session ID
- **Fix**: Models are now saved as `ModelName_TrainingNumber.extension` (e.g., `WeatherPrediction_3.pkl`)

### 2. Best Accuracy Display Clarification
- **Issue**: User reported "se muestra la mejor precision de siempre en vez de la mejor precision del entrenamiento"
- **Analysis**: The system correctly shows:
  - In model cards: "Meilleur" (Best) - This shows the best score from ALL trainings of that model (this is correct)
  - During training progress: Shows current training's accuracy (this is correct)
  - After training completion: Shows the test accuracy from the current training session (this is correct)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Model File Naming Changes (ml_utils.py)

#### For TensorFlow Models:
```python
# Generate filename with model name and training number
model_name = session.name if session.name else f"model_{session.id}"
clean_model_name = "".join(c for c in model_name if c.isalnum() or c in (' ', '-', '_')).strip()
clean_model_name = clean_model_name.replace(' ', '_')

# Get training number
training_number = 1
if session.model_definition:
    training_number = session.__class__.objects.filter(
        model_definition=session.model_definition,
        status='completed',
        id__lte=session.id
    ).count() + 1

filename = f"{clean_model_name}_{training_number}"
```

#### Applied to all model types:
- TensorFlow: `ModelName_3.zip`
- PyTorch: `ModelName_3.pth`
- Sklearn (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.): `ModelName_3.pkl`

### 2. Accuracy Display Locations

#### A. Model Card (models.html) - Shows ALL TIME best:
```html
<div class="stat-value">${model.best_score ? (model.best_score * 100).toFixed(1) : '-'}%</div>
<div class="text-muted small">Meilleur</div>
```
This correctly shows the best score across ALL trainings of this model definition.

#### B. Training Progress (training_progress.html) - Shows CURRENT training:
```javascript
if (metrics.accuracy !== undefined) {
    score = (metrics.accuracy * 100).toFixed(1) + '%';
    label = 'Précision du Modèle';
}
```
This correctly shows the test accuracy from the current training session.

#### C. Training Results (training_results.html) - Shows CURRENT training results:
This page shows detailed metrics from the specific training session, not historical bests.

## No Changes Needed for Accuracy Display

The system is already correctly implemented:
- Model cards show historical best (useful for comparing model definitions)
- Training progress shows current training metrics
- Training results show specific session results

If the user wants to see "best accuracy during current training" (best epoch), this would require:
1. Tracking best metrics across epochs during training
2. Displaying both current epoch metrics AND best epoch metrics
3. This would be a new feature, not a bug fix

## Benefits of Model Naming Fix

1. **Clarity**: Users can identify which training session produced which file
2. **Organization**: Files are sorted naturally by model and training order
3. **Traceability**: Easy to match files to training sessions
4. **Professional**: Clean, meaningful filenames for production use

## Testing the Changes

1. Train a model and verify the saved file has format: `ModelName_TrainingNumber.extension`
2. Train the same model multiple times and verify numbering increments
3. Check that special characters in model names are properly cleaned
4. Verify that models without names fall back to `model_sessionID` format
