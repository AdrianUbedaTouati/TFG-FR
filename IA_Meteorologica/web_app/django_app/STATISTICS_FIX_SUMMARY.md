# Statistics Fix Summary

## Issue
The normalization preview was showing incorrect statistics for normalized columns. Specifically, the unique count was being calculated on the sample data (e.g., showing 5 unique values) instead of the full dataset (which could have 27 unique values).

## Root Cause
In `ml_trainer/views/normalization_views.py`, the `DatasetNormalizationPreviewView` was:
1. Creating a sample of the data: `sample_df = df.head(sample_size)`
2. Applying normalization to this sample: `normalized_sample = view._apply_normalization(sample_df, normalization_config)`
3. Calculating statistics on the normalized sample instead of the full normalized dataset

## Solution
Modified the code to:
1. Apply normalization to both the sample (for preview) and the full dataset (for statistics)
2. Use the full normalized dataset when calculating statistics

### Changes Made

1. **Added full dataset normalization** (line ~1457):
```python
# Apply normalization to full dataset for accurate statistics
# This is done separately to get correct unique counts
normalized_full = view._apply_normalization(df, normalization_config)
```

2. **Updated statistics calculation for regular columns** (lines ~1834 and ~1848):
```python
'stats': detect_column_type(normalized_full[target_column] if target_column in normalized_full.columns else normalized_full[column])  # Use full normalized dataset for stats
```

3. **Updated statistics calculation for custom function outputs** (lines ~1634-1635):
```python
'stats': detect_column_type(normalized_full[new_col] if new_col in normalized_full.columns else normalized_sample[new_col]),
'unique_count': normalized_full[new_col].nunique() if new_col in normalized_full.columns else normalized_sample[new_col].nunique(),
```

## Result
Now the statistics section in the normalization preview shows the correct unique count based on the full dataset, not just the sample. For example, if the full dataset has 27 unique values, it will show 27 instead of just the 5 that might be in the sample.

## Performance Consideration
This change does add some overhead as we now normalize the full dataset for preview. However, this is necessary to get accurate statistics. The sample is still used for the actual preview data to keep the UI responsive.
