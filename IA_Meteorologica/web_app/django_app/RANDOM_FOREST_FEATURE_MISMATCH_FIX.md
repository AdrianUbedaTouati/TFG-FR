# Random Forest Feature Mismatch Fix

## Problem
When training Random Forest models, the error "X has 15 features, but RandomForestClassifier is expecting 29 features as input" occurred during validation. This was because:

1. Categorical encoding (OneHotEncoder) was applied inside `train_sklearn_model` but created new encoders for train and validation sets separately
2. The encoders were not saved, so predictions couldn't apply the same transformations
3. Preprocessing was inconsistent between training and prediction

## Solution

### 1. Created Preprocessing Pipeline (`sklearn_preprocessing_fix.py`)
A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that:
- Handles categorical encoding consistently
- Adds cyclic features for temporal data
- Saves encoder states for reuse
- Ensures feature consistency across train/validation/test sets

Key features:
```python
class SklearnPreprocessingPipeline:
    def __init__(self, predictor_columns, categorical_columns=None, cyclic_columns=None, 
                 encoding_method='onehot', normalization_method='min_max'):
        # Stores encoders and feature transformations
        
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Fits encoders and stores feature names
        
    def transform(self, X):
        # Applies same transformations with fitted encoders
        
    def save(self, filepath):
        # Saves entire pipeline state
```

### 2. Updated `train_sklearn_model` in `ml_utils.py`
- Uses preprocessing pipeline instead of direct encoding
- Saves pipeline with the model
- Stores preprocessing info in the session

```python
# Create preprocessing pipeline
preprocessing_pipeline = SklearnPreprocessingPipeline(
    predictor_columns=predictor_columns,
    categorical_columns=categorical_columns,
    cyclic_columns=cyclic_columns,
    encoding_method=encoding_method,
    normalization_method='none'
)

# Fit and transform data
X_train = preprocessing_pipeline.fit_transform(X_train_df, y_train)
X_val = preprocessing_pipeline.transform(X_val_df)  # Uses same encoders!
```

### 3. Updated Model Saving
Models now save with preprocessing pipeline:
```python
joblib.dump({
    'model': model,
    'scaler_X': scaler_X,
    'scaler_y': scaler_y,
    'predictor_columns': session.predictor_columns,
    'target_columns': session.target_columns,
    'preprocessing_pipeline': preprocessing_pipeline,
    'preprocessing_info': session.preprocessing_info
}, model_path)
```

### 4. Updated Prediction (`make_predictions`)
Predictions now use the saved preprocessing pipeline:
```python
if not is_neural and preprocessing_pipeline:
    # Use preprocessing pipeline
    X_df = df[session.predictor_columns]
    X = preprocessing_pipeline.transform(X_df)
```

### 5. Enhanced Training Logs
- Added `update_message` method to `SklearnProgressCallback`
- Random Forest training now shows:
  - Number of trees being trained
  - OOB scores during training
  - Feature engineering steps
  - Detailed progress messages

## Files Modified

1. **Created `sklearn_preprocessing_fix.py`**: Complete preprocessing pipeline
2. **Modified `ml_utils.py`**:
   - Import preprocessing pipeline
   - Update `train_sklearn_model` to use pipeline
   - Update model saving to include pipeline
   - Update `make_predictions` to use saved pipeline
3. **Modified `training_callbacks.py`**: Added `update_message` method
4. **Already exists `training-progress-enhanced.js`**: Shows Random Forest specific logs

## Testing

Created `test_random_forest_fix.py` that:
- Creates a dataset with numeric, categorical, and cyclic features
- Trains a Random Forest model with all preprocessing
- Tests prediction with the saved pipeline
- Verifies feature consistency

## Migration Already Applied

The `preprocessing_info` field was already added to TrainingSession model via migration 0021.

## Result

âœ… Random Forest models now:
- Apply consistent preprocessing across all data splits
- Save preprocessing state for predictions
- Show detailed training progress
- Handle mixed feature types correctly
- No more feature mismatch errors!
